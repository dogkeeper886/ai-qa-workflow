## Progress Checklist

Copy and track your progress:

```
- [ ] Step 1: Read project context
- [ ] Step 2: Extract reviewers from Jira ticket
- [ ] Step 3: Draft review email
- [ ] Step 4: Draft meeting invite
- [ ] Validate: Preview both drafts and confirm before saving
```

## Steps

### Step 1: Read Project Context

Read these files from the project folder:
- `README.md` — project overview and ticket ID
- `test_plan/README.md` — test plan type, scenario count
- `test_cases/README.md` — test case count
- `confluence/confluence_links.md` — Confluence page URLs

### Step 2: Extract Reviewers

Fetch the Jira ticket using `mcp-atlassian:jira_get_issue` to identify:
- Assignee (primary reviewer)
- Reporter (stakeholder)
- Watchers (additional reviewers)
- Any reviewer names mentioned in comments

### Step 3: Draft Review Email

Create the email using the template in `references/email-template.md`.

**Exclude:**
- Feature flags (internal implementation detail)
- Backend values (e.g., "-1 means unlimited")
- Navigation steps (save for demo)
- Customer names (unless approved)

### Step 4: Draft Meeting Invite

Create the meeting invite using the template in `references/meeting-invite.md`.

Use reference-style links (URLs at bottom) to keep the body scannable.

### Validate

Show both full drafts to the user. Ask: "Do these look good? Should I save them to files?"

**Do NOT save to disk until the user confirms.**

After confirmation, save:
- `demo/Demo_Showcase_Email.md` — email draft
- `Meeting_Invite_[Type]_Review.md` — meeting invite

## Expected Input

Path to project folder containing README.md, test_plan/, test_cases/, and confluence/ files.

### Dev flow: story-driven vs issue-driven (complementary)

| Capability | ruckus1-mcp (story-driven) | ai-qa-workflow (issue-driven) |
|---|---|---|
| Requirements capture | dev-story (structured story files) | Not present |
| Break into issues | dev-tasks (reads story) | dw-plan (freeform input, duplicate check, labels) |
| Implement | dev-impl (project-specific) | dw-implement (generic, failure handling) |
| PR creation | Not present | dw-create-pr |
| PR review | Not present | dw-review-pr |
| Merge & cleanup | Not present | dw-merge |

**Decision:** Complementary. Backport `dev-story` to ai-qa-workflow as `dw-story`. Drop `dev-tasks` and `dev-impl` (subsumed by dw-*).

## Remote-only (future phases)

| MCP tool patterns (CLAUDE.md) | ~400 | Phase 3 — separate issue |
| add-tool.md | 305 | Phase 3 — separate issue |

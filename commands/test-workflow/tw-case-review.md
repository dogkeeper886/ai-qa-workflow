# Test Case Review

Review test cases for quality and completeness before TestLink sync.

## Purpose

Analyze test case files to:
1. Verify test case quality (clear steps, measurable results)
2. Check completeness (all scenarios covered, no gaps)
3. Identify issues early before TestLink sync
4. Recommend priorities for TestLink sync
5. Ensure test cases are ready for execution

## Prerequisites

- `test_cases/README.md` exists (created by `/tw-case-*` commands)
- `test_cases/TS-XX_*.md` files exist for each scenario
- `test_plan/README.md` and `test_plan/sections/` exist (for comparison)

**If test cases are missing:**
```
Ask user: "Please run /tw-case-init first to create test cases."
STOP - Cannot proceed without test case files
```

## When to Use

- **After** running `/tw-case-feature`, `/tw-case-bugfix`, or `/tw-case-enhance`
- **Before** running `/tl-sync`
- When updating existing test cases
- Before test execution begins

## Review Profiles

The review depth is **auto-detected** from the test plan type. The user can override by specifying a profile explicitly.

| Check | Feature (Full) | Enhancement (Standard) | Bug Fix (Focused) |
|-------|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Core Quality (3.1-3.7) | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Sanitization (3.9) | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Completeness (Step 4) | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Consistency (Step 5) | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Priority Recommendation (Step 7) | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Requirements Traceability (Step 6) | Yes | Yes | Skip |
| Test Data Adequacy (3.10) | Full | Lite | Skip |
| Cleanup/Postconditions (3.11) | Yes | Skip | Skip |
| Boundary Value Analysis (3.12) | Yes | Skip | Skip |

## Agent Instructions

### Step 1: Read Test Plan and Detect Profile

Read the test plan for comparison baseline and determine review profile:

```
1. Read test_plan/README.md for type and quick reference counts
2. Read the Test Strategy section file for scenario details:
   - Feature: test_plan/sections/04_Test_Strategy.md § 4.4
   - Bug Fix: test_plan/sections/03_Test_Strategy.md § 3.2
   - Enhancement: test_plan/sections/04_Test_Strategy.md § 4.2
3. Reference coverage matrix from /tw-plan-review (if available)
4. Detect review profile from test plan type:
   - "New Feature Validation" → Full profile (expect 20-40 test cases)
   - "Bug Fix Validation" → Focused profile (expect 8-15 test cases)
   - "Enhancement Validation" → Standard profile (expect 15-25 test cases)
5. Announce detected profile: "Review profile: [Full/Standard/Focused]"
```

> **Fallback:** If `test_plan/sections/` does not exist, read `test_plan/README.md` directly.

### Step 2: Read All Test Case Files

```
1. Read test_cases/README.md
   - Extract scenario index
   - Note total test case count
   - Check default assumptions section

2. Read each `test_cases/TS-XX_*.md` file
   - Count test cases per scenario
   - Extract test case names and objectives
   - Note preconditions, steps, and expected results
```

### Step 3: Quality Checks [All Profiles]

For each test case, verify the following quality criteria:

#### 3.1 Clear Objective
- [ ] Objective states WHAT is being validated
- [ ] Objective is specific, not vague
- [ ] Objective matches the test steps

**Good:** "Verify that entering a name shorter than 2 characters displays validation error"
**Bad:** "Test name validation"

#### 3.2 Complete Preconditions
- [ ] All required setup is listed
- [ ] No missing dependencies
- [ ] Preconditions use same terminology as test steps
- [ ] No items referenced in steps that aren't set up

**Good:** "User Group 'Test-Group-A' exists with 2 members assigned"
**Bad:** "User Group configured"

#### 3.3 Specific Actions
- [ ] Actions use exact values, not placeholders
- [ ] Actions specify which element to interact with
- [ ] Actions are atomic (one action per step)

**Good:** "Enter 'test@example.com' in the Email field"
**Bad:** "Enter data in the field"

#### 3.4 Measurable Expected Results
- [ ] Expected results are observable and verifiable
- [ ] Expected results include specific text/values where applicable
- [ ] Expected results describe the outcome, not the action

**Good:** "Error message displays: 'Email format is invalid'"
**Bad:** "Verify error handling works"

#### 3.5 Appropriate Step Count
- [ ] 3-10 steps is typical for most test cases
- [ ] Flag test cases with >15 steps for potential splitting
- [ ] Flag test cases with <3 steps as potentially incomplete

#### 3.6 Test Independence
- [ ] Test can run standalone without prior tests
- [ ] All setup is in preconditions
- [ ] No reliance on state from other test cases

#### 3.7 Navigation Step Strategy
- [ ] Setup navigation is in preconditions when 3+ TCs share the same path
- [ ] Navigation condensed to 1-2 steps (no intermediate page verifications)
- [ ] No URLs/routes in test steps — page names only

#### 3.8 No Internal Labels
- [ ] Phase headers do not contain test plan mapping labels (e.g., `D1`, `D2`, `S2`)
- [ ] Step tables do not embed study/plan reference codes
- [ ] Phase names are self-descriptive (e.g., "Before Start Date", "After Deactivation") without requiring a label key lookup

**Good:** `## Phase: Before Start Date`
**Bad:** `## D1: Before Start Date`

#### 3.9 Sanitization [All Profiles]

> See also: CLAUDE.md § Test Case Design Rules > Sanitization Checklist

- [ ] No hardcoded tenant names — use generic placeholders (e.g., "TestTenant-A")
- [ ] No real credentials or passwords — use placeholders like `<password>`
- [ ] No real IP addresses — use example ranges like `10.x.x.x` or `192.168.x.x`
- [ ] No real user email addresses — use generic addresses like `testuser@example.com`
- [ ] No RBAC scope lines unless the scenario specifically tests RBAC

#### 3.10 Test Data Adequacy [Full / Standard-Lite]
- [ ] Test data values are realistic, not arbitrary placeholders
- [ ] Different test cases use distinct data to avoid masking bugs
- [ ] Data covers representative types (strings, numbers, special characters where relevant)
- **Full only:**
  - [ ] Boundary values use actual system limits (not round numbers)
  - [ ] Negative test data is included (empty, null, overflow)

#### 3.11 Cleanup/Postconditions [Full only]
- [ ] Tests that create data document whether cleanup is needed
- [ ] Tests that modify shared state note postconditions
- [ ] No test leaves the system in a state that blocks other tests

#### 3.12 Boundary Value Analysis [Full only]
- [ ] Boundary conditions tested at exact limits (min, min+1, max-1, max)
- [ ] Off-by-one scenarios are covered
- [ ] Empty and maximum states are tested where applicable

### Step 4: Completeness Check [All Profiles]

Compare test cases against test plan:

```
1. Count test cases per scenario
2. Compare against test plan estimates
3. Flag scenarios with significantly fewer test cases than expected
4. Check for missing:
   - Error handling tests
   - Edge case tests
   - Boundary condition tests
```

### Step 5: Consistency Check [All Profiles]

Verify consistency across test cases:

```
1. Terminology consistency
   - Same names used throughout (not "Group A" vs "Original-Group")
   - Same navigation paths described consistently

2. Format consistency
   - All files use same structure
   - All test cases have required sections
   - Summary tables are complete

3. Cross-reference accuracy
   - TC counts in README.md match actual files
   - Scenario references are correct
```

### Step 6: Requirements Traceability [Full / Standard]

Verify test case to requirement mapping:

```
1. List all requirements/acceptance criteria from:
   - test_plan/sections/ (scope and strategy sections)
   - confluence/HLD_*.md files in the project folder (if they exist)
   - If no HLD files exist, skip HLD and use test plan sections only

2. For each requirement, verify at least one test case covers it

3. Flag requirements with no test case coverage

4. Flag test cases that don't trace to any requirement
   (orphaned tests may indicate scope creep or missing requirements)
```

> **Skip for Focused (Bug Fix):** Bug fix test cases trace to the defect, not to requirements.

### Step 7: Priority Recommendation [All Profiles]

Analyze each test case and recommend a priority for TestLink sync. Priority and execution type are **not stored in markdown files** — they are managed in TestLink. This step produces recommendations to guide `/tl-sync`.

**Priority criteria:**

| Priority | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **P0 (Critical)** | Core happy path, primary defect verification (bug fix), feature must-work scenarios |
| **P1 (High)** | Important variations, common user paths, integration points, regression of related features |
| **P2 (Medium)** | Edge cases, boundary conditions, uncommon configurations, nice-to-have coverage |

**Decision tree:**

```
For each test case:
1. Read the objective and steps
2. Apply priority decision tree:

   IF test case is the first/only TC for a scenario's primary flow
     → P0 (Critical)
   ELSE IF test case verifies the primary defect (bug fix projects)
     → P0 (Critical)
   ELSE IF test case tests a variation, alternate input, or integration point
     → P1 (High)
   ELSE IF test case tests regression of a related feature
     → P1 (High)
   ELSE IF test case tests edge case, boundary, or rare configuration
     → P2 (Medium)
   ELSE IF test case tests error handling for uncommon scenarios
     → P2 (Medium)

3. Check distribution — a healthy project has roughly:
   - P0: 20-30% (must-pass for release)
   - P1: 40-50% (should-pass)
   - P2: 20-30% (nice-to-pass)
4. Flag if distribution is skewed (e.g., >50% P0 suggests inflation)
```

If READY FOR TESTLINK:
1. Run `/tw-case-publish` to sync to all destinations (TestLink + Confluence) in one step
2. Or run `/tl-sync` directly to sync to TestLink only
3. Verify synced test cases in TestLink UI

If NEEDS REVISION:
1. Address "Must Fix" items
2. Re-run `/tw-case-review` to verify fixes
3. Then proceed to `/tw-case-publish` or `/tl-sync`
```

    │   - Use: gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/milestones --jq '.[] | select(.title | contains("PROJ-12345"))'
    │   - If not found: "No milestone found. Run /gh-init PROJ-12345 first."
    │

## EXAMPLE

```bash
/gh-status PROJ-12345
```

---

## USE CASES

### Session Start
Run at the beginning of a new session to see where you left off:
```
/gh-status PROJ-12345
```
The agent reads open tasks and resumes work without asking the user.

### Progress Check
Run mid-session to see how much work remains:
```
/gh-status PROJ-12345
```

### Milestone Completion
When all issues are closed, the milestone can be closed:
```
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/milestones/{number} --method PATCH -f state=closed
```

---

## API Notes

- Uses `gh` CLI (GitHub CLI)
- Parses task lists from issue bodies (GitHub-flavored markdown checkboxes)
- Shows both open and closed issues for complete picture
- Milestone search is case-insensitive substring match on ticket ID
```

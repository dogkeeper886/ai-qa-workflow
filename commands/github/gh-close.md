## WORKFLOW

```
/gh-close 12
    │
    ├─► Step 1: Verify Completion
    │   - Fetch issue body: gh issue view <number> --json body,title,labels
    │   - Parse task list: count checked vs unchecked
    │   - If unchecked tasks remain:
    │     • Warn: "Issue #12 has 2 unchecked tasks. Close anyway? (y/n)"
    │     • If user says no, stop
    │     • If user says yes, proceed (partial completion)
    │
    ├─► Step 2: Generate Summary Comment
    │   - List completed tasks
    │   - List skipped/deferred tasks (if any)
    │   - Reference PR number if current branch has a PR
    │   - Note artifacts created or modified
    │
    ├─► Step 3: Close Issue
    │   - Add summary comment: gh issue comment <number> --body "<summary>"
    │   - Close: gh issue close <number>
    │   - If a PR exists that addresses this issue, prefer closing via
    │     "Fixes #N" in the PR description instead
    │
    └─► Step 4: Report
        - Print closed issue number and URL
        - Print summary of completed work
        - Suggest next action (next open issue from /gh-status)

Close anyway? (y/n)

> y

Deferred: TS-03 scope clarification (waiting on PM).
```

### Example 3: Close via PR

If you have a branch with changes for this issue, include "Fixes #12" in the PR description. The issue will auto-close when the PR merges.

gh pr create --title "[QA] Address review feedback for PROJ-12345" \
  --body "Fixes #12" --milestone "PROJ-12345 — User Session Management"
```

## API Notes

- Uses `gh` CLI (GitHub CLI)
- Prefer closing via PR "Fixes #N" for automatic traceability
- Summary comment provides a final record of what was done
- Deferred tasks should be tracked in a new issue if follow-up is needed
```
